# Yes-Bank-Stock-ML-Prediction
This project aims to predict the monthly closing stock price of Yes Bank using historical data, including opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices. The project employs (EDA), feature engineering, and various ML models to achieve accurate predictions.

**Project Name - "Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction".**

**Project Summary:** **This project aims to predict the monthly closing stock price of Yes Bank using historical data, including opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices. The project employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and various machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions. The dataset includes monthly stock prices of Yes Bank from its inception until now, and the main objective is to develop a robust model that can predict future closing prices, aiding investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions.**


* **Problem Statement:** **Predict the monthly closing stock price of Yes Bank using historical stock price data, considering the significant impact of events such as the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor on the stock prices.**

* **Let's Begin:**

  1. Know Your Data.
  2. Understanding Your Variables.
  3. Data Wrangling.
  4. Data Vizualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts : Understand the relationships between variables.
  5.  Hypothesis Testing.
  6.  Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing.
  7.  ML Model Implementation.
  8.  Future Work.


* **IN ML MODEL I HAVE USED 3 MODELS**
*  **ML Model - [1] Linear Regression (LR)**
*  **ML Model - [2] Decision Tree Regressor (DT)**
*  **ML Model - [3] Random Forest Regressor (RF)**

*  **FINAL MODEL IMPLEMENTATION:**  **I Have Choose RF Model**

**Choosing Random Forest Regressor: Performance Metrics: The Random Forest Regressor achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0332 and the highest R-squared (R2) score of 0.9613 compared to the Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor models. This indicates that the Random Forest model has the best predictive accuracy and explains the highest proportion of variance in the dependent variable.**

**Linear Regression: MSE: 0.1782, R2: 0.7922**

**Decision Tree Regressor: MSE: 0.0432, R2: 0.9496**

**Random Forest Regressor: MSE: 0.0332, R2: 0.9613**

*Generalization: Random Forests tend to perform better on unseen data due to their ensemble nature, reducing the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree.*

*Robustness: Random Forests are less sensitive to outliers and noise in the data, making them more robust compared to other models.*


* **Conclusion:**
**The Random Forest Regressor model demonstrated the best performance with the highest R2 score and lowest MSE, making it the chosen model for predicting Yes Bank's monthly closing stock prices. The insights gained from this project can assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions.**
